## Introduction

Welcome to the Machine Learning Capstone Project, a comprehensive exploration of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model implementation, and evaluation. This project aims to demonstrate the complete lifecycle of a machine learning project, from data preparation to model deployment.

## Project Overview

- **Data Collection:** We started by collecting data related to customer reviews, restaurants, and other relevant information.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Extensive data preprocessing was carried out to handle missing values, clean the data, and prepare it for analysis.

- **Feature Engineering:** We created new features, removed redundant ones, and applied various text preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of the data.

- **ML Model Implementation:** We implemented two machine learning models: K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to gain insights from the data.

- **Model Evaluation:** The models were evaluated based on various metrics, including Silhouette Score, ROC AUC, and more.

## Preprocessing Data

- Data collection included reviews, restaurant information, and more.
- Extensive data cleaning and handling of missing values.
- Text preprocessing, including expansion of contractions, lowercasing, and removal of punctuation, URLs, digits, stopwords, and whitespace.

## Feature Engineering

- New features were created to minimize feature correlation.
- Sentiment analysis was performed on reviews, classifying them as positive or negative based on average ratings.
- The 'Cost' feature was log-transformed to address positive skewness.

## ML Model Implementation

Two machine learning models were implemented:

- **K-means Clustering:** Data was clustered into 6 groups to gain insights into restaurant features.
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** Used for topic modeling and analysis of customer reviews.

## Conclusion

- Significant improvements were observed in the clustering results, especially in the selection of an appropriate value for K.
- The LDA model was fine-tuned to improve the Silhouette Score.
- Extensive model evaluation, including ROC AUC, precision, recall, and more, was performed.
- The project provides a comprehensive guide on how to go from data preprocessing to model implementation and evaluation.
